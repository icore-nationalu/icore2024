          <p>
            ITiCSE papers are reviewed using a dual-anonymous process managed
            through EasyChair. The reviewing process has three phases: bidding,
            reviewing, and discussion and metareviewing.
            <br /> <br />
            Reviewers are expected to provide high-quality reviews to provide
            authors with feedback that will help to improve the work for
            publication or for future submission. Program committee members
            (formerly known as associate program chairs) lead the discussion
            among reviewers and metareview each paper, providing a
            recommendation and feedback to the program chairs. A change for
            ITiCSE 2024 is that reviewers and program committee members will be
            allocated papers from only one track. Reviewers and program
            committee members will be asked to nominate the track or tracks for
            which they would prefer to review or metareview and every effort
            will be made to give them their preference.
            <br /> <br />
            Each paper submission is expected to receive three or four reviews
            and a metareview, but this number depends on the number of
            submissions and the number of reviewers and program committee
            members.
            <br /> <br />
            All reviews are submitted through EasyChair. In EasyChair, reviewers
            are called ‘ordinary PC members’ and program committee members are
            called ‘senior PC members’.
            <br /> <br />
            All paper submissions are anonymous. Reviewers and program committee
            members are and should remain anonymous to one another and to the
            authors of the submissions they review. When writing comments on a
            review during a discussion, please refer to yourself and other
            reviewers by the number of their review (R1, R2, etc).
          </p>

          <h3>Reviewer and program committee member timeline</h3>
          <p>
            The following dates describe the timeline for reviewer & program
            committee member work on ITiCSE 2024. Note that the review period is
            just two and a half weeks.
            <br /> <br />
            All reviewers and program committee members are expected to engage
            with the process throughout the five weeks from Monday 15 January to
            Wednesday 21 February, as described below. Please consider your
            workload and other commitments around these dates before offering
            your services as a reviewer or program committee member. Those who
            cannot commit to engagement throughout this period should not
            volunteer to be reviewers or program committee members for ITiCSE
            2024.
          </p>

          <h3>Expected workload</h3>
          <p>
            Reviewers: 3-5 full papers (each up to 6 pages + references)
            <br /> <br />
            Program committee members: 7-10 full papers (each up to 6 pages +
            references)
            <br /> <br />
            These estimates are based on the workloads over the past few years.
            Of course, they are subject to the number of submissions, so actual
            workloads for ITiCSE 2024 might be a little higher or lower.
            <br /> <br />
            The program chairs will generally not accommodate requests for
            lighter review loads. If you are not able to commit to the full
            load, please do not volunteer your services.
          </p>

          <h3>Bidding</h3>
          <p>
            Reviewers and program committee members will bid for papers that
            they are interested in reviewing or metareviewing in the paper track
            they have been allocated the during the week between abstract
            submission and full paper submission. If reviewers take the bidding
            process seriously, this reduces the chance of weak reviews arising
            from a lack of familiarity with the content of a submission. As part
            of the bidding process, reviewers will be required to note papers
            with which they have a conflict of interest (papers that they
            recognise are from colleagues or project partners). Separately from
            the bidding, reviewers will be shown a list of authors and asked to
            indicate which of those they have a conflict of interest with.
            <br /> <br />
            It is important to understand that bidding does not mean choosing
            the papers you will review. That choice will be made by EasyChair,
            using an algorithm that tries to allocate the papers reasonably
            fairly. Ideally, bidding is a process of identifying all of the
            papers that you would like to review or are willing to review. The
            more papers you bid for, the more likely you are to be allocated
            papers from your list.
            <br /> <br />
            Bidding on just a small number of papers influences the algorithm
            unfairly in your favour. To counter this, anyone who bids on too few
            papers will have their bids supplemented with an arbitrary selection
            of papers. If you do not wish this to happen to you, please ensure
            that you bid ‘yes’ for at least 12 papers and ‘yes’ or ‘maybe’ for
            at least 12 more.
            <br /> <br />
            Once you are notified that bidding is open, you should log in to
            your EasyChair account and access the ITiCSE 2023 conference with
            the appropriate role (‘ordinary PC member’ or ‘senior PC member’).
            From the menu, click on Paper Bidding. You will see a list of the
            submissions, and you can click links to indicate your level of
            interest in reviewing each submission. To see the abstracts as well
            as the titles, click either Show full abstracts or Show abstract
            summaries at the upper right of the screen.
            <br /> <br />
            There is no need to click No for papers you do not wish to review;
            No is the default option. You should click Conflict for a paper if
            you believe you know who wrote it, and thus cannot be sure of
            reviewing it impartially.
            <br /> <br />
            The papers are presented in a random order for each bidder, to help
            ensure a good spread of bids. However, this order is preserved for
            each bidder, so if you spread your bidding over several sessions,
            the papers will appear in the same order each time you access them.
            <br /> <br />
            The bids are colour-coded, but the selected yes/maybe/no/conflict
            link is also indicated in bold face, which will help those who have
            trouble distinguishing the colours.

            </div>

            <h3>Reviewer responsibilities</h3>
            <p>
              NU A few days after the close of bidding, reviewers and program
              committee members will be notified which papers they have been
              assigned, and paper reviewing will begin.
              <br /> <br />
              Reviewers are urged to download their assigned papers immediately
              and take a first look at them. If, for example, you discover that
              you cannot review a paper because you have discovered a conflict
              of interest, we would far rather be informed in the first few days
              of reviewing than on the last day.
              <br /> <br />
              When you log in to the appropriate role on EasyChair you will see
              a Reviews menu. On this page, you can download the papers assigned
              to you. You should also click Add Review for one of the papers, to
              get a first look at the review form – but don’t submit the review
              until you’ve written it!
              <br /> <br />
              Please aim to complete your reviews before the deadline; it is a
              deadline, not a target submission time. When reviewers leave the
              task till the last minute, things can go wrong (illness, work
              emergency, family emergency, reviewing taking longer than you
              anticipated), and then the reviews are not done by the deadline –
              which means that we are left asking for volunteers to review extra
              papers at very short notice.
              <br /> <br />
              There will be periodic reminders during the review period. If at
              any time during this period you become aware that you will not
              have your reviews written by the deadline, please contact us
              immediately so that we can decide how to deal with it.
              <br /> <br />
              Once you have submitted your review for a paper, you will be able
              to see the other reviews already submitted for that paper, and
              EasyChair will notify you by email when further reviews are
              submitted. Please consider these other reviews, in preparation for
              the discussion period.
              <br /> <br />
              Here are some points that you should consider when reviewing.
              <br /> <br />
              1. Is the paper within the scope of ITiCSE? Is it about the
              education of students who are studying computing? Is it pertinent
              to the track for which it has been submitted?
              <br /> <br />
              2. Your review should be written by you; please do not farm your
              reviews out to other people. If you believe that other people
              should be reviewing for ITiCSE, please encourage them to do so in
              their own right. If you do not have the time or the inclination to
              do your own reviewing for ITiCSE, please do not volunteer to do
              so.
              <br /> <br />
              3. Your review should indicate whether the paper as submitted is
              acceptable for ITiCSE. There is no review-revise-review cycle, so
              papers should be marked as accept if they are currently
              acceptable, not if they have the potential to become acceptable
              after substantial revision. In particular, ITiCSE does not have a
              conditional acceptance. If a paper cannot be made acceptable with
              grammatical corrections and/or minor revisions of content, you
              should recommend that it be rejected.
              <br /> <br />
              4. Whether or not a paper is accepted, the authors will want to
              know why. Please ensure that your review gives reasons,
              explanations, and examples of the points you make. Reviews just a
              few lines long are generally not helpful to the authors, the
              program committee members, or the program chairs. Authors should
              be able to see the text parts of the reviews as a constructive
              critique of their submission.
              <br /> <br />
              5. Be sure that your overall recommendation tallies with your
              impression of the paper. If you do not believe that the paper
              should be accepted, please do not give it a 4 just to be nice, or
              to err on the side of generosity. It is more helpful to the
              program chairs, the program committee members, and the authors if
              your review is honest and transparent and your overall
              recommendation reflects your impression.
              <br /> <br />
              6. ITiCSE reviewing is dual-anonymous. You should not know who
              wrote the papers that you review, and the authors should not know
              who reviewed it. Please, therefore, take care not to divulge your
              identity in your review, for example by saying ‘This paper that I
              wrote might be helpful to you’ or by recommending the addition of
              references to a number of papers all of which you have
              (co-)authored.
              <br /> <br />
              7. Please appreciate that authors sometimes have to omit or
              disguise references to their own work in order for their paper to
              be anonymous. As a reviewer, you may give the authors the benefit
              of the doubt. Use the ‘Confidential comments to the committee’ box
              to indicate this to the program chairs; for example “This paper
              should reference Kim Lee’s work, unless those references were
              removed for anonymity”.
              <br /> <br />
              8. If you find that a paper you are reviewing is not completely
              anonymous, you may point this out to the authors. However, please
              do not divulge the authors’ identity to the other reviewers or the
              program committee member, and please continue to review the paper
              as though it were anonymous. If you feel that you cannot review it
              objectively, please notify the program chairs immediately.
              <br /> <br />
              9. Most papers have some flaws in their writing. The reviewers are
              not required to be editors, pointing out every flaw that requires
              correction. However, some reviewers choose to do this, and many
              authors appear to appreciate the additional service. The review
              form has a specific field for such suggestions, keeping them
              distinct from the strengths and weaknesses and the overall
              evaluation of the paper.
              <br /> <br />
              10. It is a good idea for reviews to be grammatically correct –
              especially if they criticise the grammar of the paper. Just as a
              poorly written paper gives the reader a poor first impression, a
              poorly written review can make the authors less inclined to accept
              its content. Please read your own reviews carefully, and, if
              necessary, submit revised versions with the spelling and grammar
              errors corrected. If you choose to draw attention to spelling
              issues in a paper, please be aware that many words have different
              spellings in different parts of the English-speaking world.
              Neither ‘analyze’ nor ‘analyse’ is wrong: they are different
              acceptable spellings; likewise ‘program’ and ‘programme’,
              ‘behavior’ and ‘behaviour’, and many more such pairs.
              <br /> <br />
              11. Please keep in mind the track for which you are reviewing.
              There are three tracks: computing education research; experience
              reports and tools; and position papers and proposals. Different
              guidelines apply to each track, and it would be unreasonable, for
              example, to review an experience report as though it were a
              research paper. See Paper track guidelines below for the
              guidelines for each track.
              <br /> <br />
              12. Good papers will be relevant to an international audience.
              ITiCSE certainly accepts papers based on work from specific
              countries, but such papers are more valuable if they have clear
              insights for people from other countries. For example, a paper
              that writes about making it easier for people from the mountain
              regions to succeed in a computing degree would be better received
              if it made a clear generalisation to other underrepresented
              minorities – or perhaps to people with better lung capacity –
              regardless of country.
              <br /> <br />
              13. The limit of six pages (with references possibly extending
              onto a seventh page) is a maximum, not a minimum. There is nothing
              wrong with shorter papers if they are good and pertinent; they do
              not need to be padded out to six pages. At the same time, if a
              shorter paper clearly lacks something that would have strengthened
              it, feel free to point that out to the authors.
              <br /> <br />
              14. Authors are not permitted to provide links to supplementary
              materials in a review submission. Author guidelines make it clear
              that the paper should still stand on its own merits. If authors
              overlook this guideline and provide links to supplementary
              material, reviewers are not expected to access those links and
              examine the material.
              <br /> <br />
              15. It is acceptable to point out formatting issues, but not to
              make them the deciding factor in a recommendation to reject. Some
              authors are still struggling to come to grips with the ACM
              templates. One version of the template even results in a
              single-column pdf. If in doubt, leave it to the proceedings chair
              to decide on a paper’s compatibility with the template.
              <br /> <br />
              16. Please be aware that different versions of the ACM template
              have different placeholders for the title and the authors’ names.
              There is nothing insidious about a paper that says it is being
              submitted to WOODSTOCK’18, June, 2018, El Paso, Texas USA, or that
              its authors are F. Surname et al. or G. Gubbiotti et al.; these
              are all defaults in different versions of the template. As with
              other aspects of the formatting, assume that it will be fixed if
              and when the paper is accepted for publication and revised.
            </p>

            <h3>Program committee member responsibilities</h3>
            <p>
              Each submission will be assigned to one program committee member.
              As a program committee member, please carefully read each
              submission at the start of the review period so that you will be
              able to relate the reviews to it as they are submitted. You are
              expected to watch the reviews for your assigned papers as they
              come in; to do this you will need to explicitly add them to your
              watchlist so that you will receive email notifications. From the
              ITiCSE 2024 menu choose My watchlist, choose the Select all
              option, then Save watchlist. As the reviews arrive, please keep an
              eye open for obvious problems: a review might have been submitted
              for the wrong paper, or might identify the author or the reviewer,
              or might be so brief as to be unhelpful. We will do our best to
              notice such problems, but your attention will also help.
              <br /> <br />
              Unlike some other conferences, ITiCSE keeps track of review
              completion, sends a number of review reminders, and chases
              unresponsive reviewers. Reviewers can become confused if they
              receive multiple reminders from the same EasyChair email address –
              for example, they might respond to a reminder from the chairs, and
              then a few hours later receive another reminder from a program
              committee member. Therefore we explicitly ask program committee
              members not to send reminders to reviewers, and indeed not to send
              any emails to reviewers, but to limit their communications to the
              comment feature of EasyChair and their eventual metareviews

              Despite the best of intentions, some reviewers find that they are
              not able to review the papers assigned to them and others simply
              drop out of contact for various reasons. The program chairs often
              discover this only at the end of the reviewing period. They then
              need to find reviewers who have completed their assigned reviews
              and are able to review one or two more papers within a day or two.
              <br /> <br />
              The call for emergency reviewers generally goes to all reviewers,
              but there is no expectation that all reviewers will respond. We
              understand that most reviewers now have other calls on their time,
              and we are appreciative and grateful that a few are able to step
              in and take on this additional load.

              <h2>Discussion and metareviewing</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
              The discussion period facilitates communication among the
              reviewers and program committee members to ensure that the program
              committee member makes the best recommendation to the program
              chairs and the submission is given full consideration in the
              review process.
            </p>

            <h3>Reviewer responsibilities during discussion and metareview</h3>
            <p>
              As a reviewer, you are expected to engage with the discussion on
              each of your papers during the discussion period. Read the reviews
              from the other reviewers and take part in the discussion using the
              Comments feature in EasyChair (beneath all the reviews). Your
              comments will not be sent to the paper’s authors, but the final
              version of your review will. If, after reading the other reviews
              and taking part in the discussion, you are inclined to revise your
              review, please do so. There is no obligation to revise your
              reviews, but your review should reflect your final impression of
              the paper, and compatible reviews from all reviewers make matters
              easier for the program committee members, the program chairs, and
              the authors of the submission.
              <br /> <br />
              If you do revise your review, please do not refer explicitly to
              other reviews. It is not appropriate to write, for example, “I
              agree with Reviewer 3 about the paper’s shortcomings”. It should
              be possible to read each review independently of the others. If
              you do wish to explain why you have revised your review, please
              say it in the Confidential comments part, where it will be seen by
              the other reviewers, the program committee members, and the
              program chairs, but not by the paper’s authors.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Program committee members responsibilities during discussion and
              metareview
            </h3>
            <p>
              As a program committee member, you will lead and encourage
              discussion among the reviewers, especially for submissions with
              divergent reviews. This discussion will help you to form an
              opinion on whether the paper should be accepted.
              <br /> <br />
              Ideally, the reviewers and the program committee members will come
              close to consensus on the quality of the submission. Different
              reviewers might see different strengths and weaknesses in the
              paper, or might weight those strengths and weaknesses differently.
              However, it would be good if all reviewers, after reading the
              other reviews and taking part in the discussion, have fairly
              similar opinions about the paper overall, and are willing to
              revise their reviews if necessary to reflect those opinions.
              <br /> <br />
              On the other hand, reviewers should never feel coerced to change
              their reviews, scores, or viewpoints in this process.
              <br /> <br />
              The program committee members will write a metareview, summarising
              the reviews, adding their own opinion if appropriate, and
              providing a recommendation for the program chairs. If the reviews
              are divergent, it is important for the metareview to summarise
              both positions. This metareview will be sent to the authors along
              with the regular reviews.
              <br /> <br />
              The text of the metareview should not explicitly include the
              program committee member’s accept/reject recommendation; there is
              a separate field for that. As a program committee member, you will
              only see a few of the submitted papers; please understand that
              your recommendation will be carefully considered, but that the
              program chairs might choose the opposite outcome when considering
              the full set of submissions and working to put together a broad
              yet coherent program. At the same time, please remember to select
              a recommendation. Recommendations to accept or reject are far more
              helpful to the program chairs than ‘undecided’, which should be
              reserved for the really difficult ones.
              <br /> <br />
              Please do not wait until the very end of the discussion period to
              write your metareviews.
              <br /> <br />
              Program committee members who are unsure what to put into a
              metareview might consider starting with a simple four-paragraph
              template: what the paper is about; what’s good about it; what’s
              not good about it; your overall opinion. An alternative approach
              would be to briefly note the key points made each reviewer, then
              to add your own opinions. Remember that you are a senior reviewer:
              your role is not to repeat what the reviewers have already said,
              but to coalesce it into a single overall impression, which can
              certainly include your own thoughts on the paper.
              <br /> <br />
              Program committee members should note that confidential comments
              in the metareview are visible to all of the paper’s reviewers as
              well as the program chairs. If you wish to communicate just with
              the program chairs, please do so by email.
              <br /> <br />
              Additionally, the program chairs will ask program committee
              members for feedback on the quality of reviews, to help inform
              decisions about future invitations to review for ITiCSE.

              <h2>Paper track guidelines</h2>
            </div>

            <p>
              There are three tracks for papers. Reviewers and program committee
              members will generally be assigned papers across all three tracks.
              <br /> <br />
              Authors are asked to choose the track that they feel best fits
              their submission. Review the submission using the guidelines for
              the track the submission is in; not the track you would prefer it
              to be in.
            </p>

            <h3>Computing education research track</h3>
            <p>
              Papers submitted to the computing education research track
              typically describe an empirical computing education project.
              <br /> <br />
              Computing education research papers should adhere to rigorous
              standards, describing research questions or hypotheses, methods,
              and results as is typical for research studies. These will
              normally focus on topics relevant to computing education with
              emphasis on educational goals and knowledge units or topics
              relevant to computing education with statistical rigour; methods
              or techniques in computing education; evaluation of pedagogical
              approaches; and studies of the many different populations that are
              engaged in computing education, including (but not limited to)
              students, instructors, and issues of gender, diversity, and
              underrepresentation. Papers need not present novel research and
              positive results to be accepted at ITiCSE: we also welcome
              replication papers and papers that present null or negative
              results, so long as they meet the criteria below.
              <br /> <br />
              For a typical paper in this track, here are some key factors to
              include (as an author) and to look for (as a reviewer):
              <br /> <br />
              Are there one or more clearly stated research questions? Since the
              rest of the paper will be organised around these, it’s often good
              to put them in the abstract and early in the body of the paper.
              <br /> <br />
              Are the questions of interest to the ITiCSE audience? Is the focus
              on the education of computing students, as opposed to education in
              general?
              <br /> <br />
              Related work in computing education
              <br /> <br />
              Is the relevant work in computing education included? If not, a
              good review will give references to missing material. It is not
              enough to write “The related work section is incomplete”.
              <br /> <br />
              Do the authors clearly describe the relationship between prior
              work and the current research questions? In what ways does the
              current project build on prior work, and how is it different?
              <br /> <br />
              Related work in educational theory
              <br /> <br />
              Is the project based on educational theory? If not, should it be
              and what are some theories the authors should consider?
              <br /> <br />
              Is the theory described clearly, with appropriate citations?
              <br /> <br />
              Is the theory’s relationship to the current project clearly
              described?
              <br /> <br />
              Is the data gathering described clearly enough that the reader
              could reproduce it? Some key information to include:
              <br /> <br />
              About the data: why this particular type of data is relevant to
              your research questions.
              <br /> <br />
              About the participants: how many, what was their background (are
              they instructors, students, graduates, etc.); what if any formal
              coursework have they had in computing; the gender distribution;
              and any other factors that are relevant to the author’s project.
              <br /> <br />
              About the people gathering the data: what is their relationship to
              the participants? For example, if the data were collected from
              students in a class, was the instructor one of the researchers?
              <br /> <br />
              About the data-gathering process: did the project use surveys,
              interviews, samples of student work, something different? If
              surveys or interviews, exactly what questions were asked?
              <br /> <br />
              About ethical approval: was appropriate ethical approval sought
              and granted for the data gathering?
              <br /> <br />
              Is the data analysis process/methodology sufficiently described
              that the reader could reproduce it?
              <br /> <br />
              What methodology was used?
              <br /> <br />
              Is the method described, with an appropriate citation?
              <br /> <br />
              Is the implementation of the method described clearly? How many
              people were involved? What process was used to resolve any
              disagreements?
              <br /> <br />
              Is the analysis process/method appropriate for answering the
              research questions?
              <br /> <br />
              Is the analysis method something new to computing education
              research that might itself be a contribution?
              <br /> <br />
              Are the results of the analysis clearly summarised?
              <br /> <br />
              Are the results thoroughly discussed, including:
              <br /> <br />
              Their relationship to the research questions
              <br /> <br />
              Their relationship to prior work
              <br /> <br />
              The implications of the results for teaching
              <br /> <br />
              The implications of the results for future research
              <br /> <br />
              Is there a discussion of threats to validity?
              <br /> <br />
              Experience reports and tools track
              <br /> <br />
              This track accepts classroom experience reports, descriptions of
              teaching techniques, and presentations of pedagogical tools and
              tools that assist in computing education research. Experience
              reports should carefully describe a computing education
              intervention and its context, and provide a rich reflection on
              what worked, what didn’t, and why. Tools papers should describe
              aspects of the tool, its purpose, its implementation, and, if
              possible, an indication of its impact when used. All papers in
              this track should provide enough detail to enable others to adopt
              the new innovation.
              <br /> <br />
              For a typical paper in this track, here are some key factors to
              include (as an author) and to look for (as a reviewer):
              <br /> <br />
              Are there one or more clearly stated goals in this paper? Since
              the rest of the paper will be organised around these, it’s often
              good to put them in the abstract and early in the body of the
              paper.
              <br /> <br />
              Is the experience or tool of interest to the ITiCSE audience? Is
              the focus on the education of computing students, as opposed to
              education in general or in other disciplines?
              <br /> <br />
              Related work in computing education
              <br /> <br />
              Is the relevant work in computing education included? If not, a
              good review will give references to missing material. It is not
              enough to write “The related work section is incomplete”.
              <br /> <br />
              Do the authors clearly describe the relationship between prior
              work and the experience being reported? In what ways does the
              current project build on prior work, and how is it different?
              <br /> <br />
              Are the observations and/or findings from the experience or the
              use of a tool clearly summarised?
              <br /> <br />
              Are the findings thoroughly discussed, including:
              <br /> <br />
              Their relationship to prior work
              <br /> <br />
              The implications of the results for future use
              <br /> <br />
              The implications of the results for teaching or computing
              education research
              <br /> <br />
              Information on how to adopt or adapt teaching techniques and/or
              tools in other contexts or institutions.
            </p>

            <h3>Position papers and proposals track</h3>
            <p>
              Papers in this track may describe new curricula, programs, or
              degrees, the motivating context for the new initiative, what it
              took to put the initiative into place, what the impact has been,
              and suggestions for others wishing to adopt it. This track also
              includes position papers, which are meant to engender fruitful
              academic discussion by presenting a defensible opinion about a
              computing education topic, substantiated with evidence. Proposals
              for future work are also included in this track.
              <br /> <br />
              Is the goal of the paper, or the innovation described by the
              paper, clearly stated? Since the rest of the paper will be
              organised around this, it’s often good to put it in the abstract
              and early in the body of the paper.
              <br /> <br />
              Description of the problem or need being addressed.
              <br /> <br />
              Is the main topic of the paper of interest to the ITiCSE audience?
              Is the focus on the education of computing students, as opposed to
              education in general or in other disciplines?
              <br /> <br />
              Related work in computing education
              <br /> <br />
              If a problem is described, what prior solutions to this problem
              exist?
              <br /> <br />
              Is the relevant work in computing education included? If not, a
              good review will give references to missing material. It is not
              enough to write “The related work section is incomplete”.
              <br /> <br />
              Do the authors clearly describe the relationship between prior
              work and the material presented in this paper? In what ways does
              the current project build on prior work, and how is it different?
              <br /> <br />
              Presentation and discussion
              <br /> <br />
              If a problem is described, how effectively does the solution
              address the problem?
              <br /> <br />
              How is the idea advanced in this paper different from previous
              ideas?
              <br /> <br />
              Has the paper discussed the implications of the topic for the
              computing education community?
              <br /> <br />
              Future success indicators
              <br /> <br />
              If an innovation is proposed, how widely could it contribute to
              the computing education community, what barriers might prevent
              widespread adoption, and how would the success of the innovation
              be measured?
              <br /> <br />
              How might the paper contribute to the computing education
              community? Who might it impact, and how?
              <br /> <br />
              Value of proposal
              <br /> <br />
              If the paper is presenting a proposal for work yet to be done,
              does the proposal itself bring value to the computing education
              community – or would it be better to wait until the work has been
              done and there are results and findings to present?
